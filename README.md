# Tower: A Simple Backend for Generating C
# ========================================

Tower is a simple and efficient backend for generating C. It is designed around an
abstrack stack machine that spits out optimized C code. Tower can also compile and execute the generated C. I plan to use Tower to generate code for my programming language Spice. Tower is still in early development and is not ready for production use. Expect bugs and breaking changes.

### Roadmap

- [x] Basic C code generation
- [x] Basic C compilation
- [x] Basic C execution
- [x] Support int and float arithmetic
- [x] Support int and float comparisons
- [x] Support int and float assignments
- [x] Support boolean operations
- [x] Support if statements
- [x] Support for functions
- [x] Support for function calls
- [ ] Support while loops
- [ ] Support collections
- [ ] Support chars
- [ ] Support strings
- [ ] Support structs
- [ ] Support pointers
- [ ] Support enums
- [ ] Support IO
- [ ] Support for modules
- [ ] Support for imports
- [ ] Bootstrap Tower in Tower using Spice
