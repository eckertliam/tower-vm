# Spice

## Version 0.1

## Introduction

Spice is an educational project I am writing. Spice is intended to be a functional programming language which compiles
to C, although I intend to eventually support WebAssembly as well. The language is a very long way from version 1.0 and will not be
usable for sometime. 

## Roadmap

I will consider Spice to be at version 1.0 once all primitives are implemented and string manipulation libraries are working. 
After version 1.0 the goal is to implement version 1.1 in Spice itself and begin working on a more sound type system (I am hacking together a bare minimum static type system for Spice < version 1.0).
